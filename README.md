### What I learned:
- This was the first game I made entirely independently. It utilises a variety of techniques that I learned through several self-driven tutorials and courses, and applies them to my original design.
- The focus of this project was to hone my C# skills and to learn the Unity game engine. As such it uses several default assets, a factor I would change if I were to re-do the project.
- The code covers usage of physics systems, timers, persistent settings, singleton patterns, and a rudimentary save system.
